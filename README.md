# Industrial Internship - 2009 at Ansell Lanka (Pvt) Ltd., Sri Lanka
Final Report

I underwent a one-month industrial training at Ansell Lanka (Pvt) Ltd., where I performed a defect analysis to 
improve the quality of their glove manufacturing process. The major objectives of this project:

1) Identify the major defects of Professional Health Care (PHC) gloves,
2) Determine the process average & average outgoing quality of PHC gloves over the time,
3) Analyze the relationships between major defect types,
4) Give an opportunity to make corrective decisions to improve the process quality,
5) Identify the variation of FIFO (First In First Out) failed lots, missing lots in dipping & packing sections over the time.

At end of this project, management of the Ansell Lanka (Pvt) Ltd. was able to make corrective decisions regarding the quality of 
the PHC gloves. Results of this study revealed the major defects and their relationships of the PHC gloves. Furthermore, 
we realized which defect types should reduce to improve the process quality efficiently. Also, the results of this analysis 
were used to show the quality performance to the Quality Assurance Review Board.
